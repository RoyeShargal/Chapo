How to run:

The project is divided into backend and frontend directories, in order to get the project fully functional we will have to run it from two terminals.

The first one, from path "./client" -> 
1. npm install
	if an error occurs:
	1.2 npm audit fix.
2. npm run

Now our frontend is visible in localhost:3000/home
*small note: the website automatically starts on 'localhost:3000/', we'll have to press HOME in order to see the home page.

The second one, from path "./server" ->
1. python api.py

Thats it.

Our project is fully up and running, FRONT and BACK.
